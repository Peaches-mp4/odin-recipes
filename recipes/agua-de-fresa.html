    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><i>Agua de fresa</i> is a delightful beverage made by blending fresh strawberries, water, sugar, and occasionally milk.</p>
        <p><i>Aguas frescas</i> (or "fresh waters") are non-alcoholic iced drinks served by street vendors in Mexico and Central America. They are typically made by combining fresh fruits, grains, seeds, herbs, spices, and sweeteners.</p> 
        <p>According to the Mexican legends, Aztecs would add ice from the dormant volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl to make this drink cold!</p>
