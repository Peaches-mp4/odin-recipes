    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><i>Agua de fresa</i> is a delightful beverage made by blending fresh strawberries, water, sugar, and occasionally milk.</p>
        <p><i>Aguas frescas</i> (or "fresh waters") are non-alcoholic iced drinks served by street vendors in Mexico and Central America. They are typically made by combining fresh fruits, grains, seeds, herbs, spices, and sweeteners.</p> 
        <p>According to the Mexican legends, Aztecs would add ice from the dormant volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl to make this drink cold!</p>
        <p>Fight the summer heat Mexican-style and enjoy this invigorating flavour explosion by following the steps below!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>350g of strawberries, sliced</li>
          <li>70g of white sugar</li> 
          <li>1l of cold water</li> 
          <li>ice for serving</li>
          <li>1 lime, cut into 8 wedges</li>
          <li>8 fresh mint sprigs</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the strawberries and cut off the green tops. You can chop them, or just throw them directly into your blender. Then, add the water and sweetener of your choosing like cane sugar, agave, stevia, etc. Add in a squeeze of lime juice at this point if you are using it.</li>
            <li>Blend the mixture on high until no chunks remain. Taste and adjust the sweetener or water to your preferences, then strain your <i>agua fresca</i> into a bowl, jar, or pitcher.</li>
            <li>Straining the mixture is not totally necessary, but it will get rid of some of the strawberry seeds! We’ll leave this step up to you.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pitcher to your fridge to chill for a few hours, or serve your strawberry agua fresca immediately over ice with mint sprigs, fresh basil, lime, or lemon wedges. Happy drinking!</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>Keep this delicious strawberry drink in a mason jar or pitcher for up to 2-3 days in the fridge. We find glass containers preserve the taste best, but feel free to use whatever container you have!</p>
