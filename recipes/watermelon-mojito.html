    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This watermelon mojito recipe is perfect for summertime parties, BBQs, birthdays, and girls' nights. Is there anything more summery than a fresh, juicy watermelon? This drink is refreshing, delicious, and super easy to make on a hot day â€” not to mention, it looks beautiful in your glass! So why not kick back, relax, and enjoy a tall glass of this mouthwatering cocktail and watch as your stresses just melt away? Garnish with lime and watermelon slices, plus fresh mint if desired.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Watermelon - try to look for a ripe and in-season watermelon, since unripe melons will not have nearly as much flavor.</li>
            <li>Mint leaves - fresh mint if possible!</li>
            <li>Lime juice - freshly squeezed is best.</li>
            <li>Light rum - I used Plantation 3 Stars white rum.</li>
            <li>Sugar - a traditional mojito uses cane sugar instead of simple syrup. I prefer to use a fine-grain sugar like caster sugar (also known as superfine) since it dissolves more easily, but if you're into the idea of undissolved sugar crystals at the bottom of the drink, go for a coarser sugar like Sugar in the Raw.</li>
            <li>Seltzer - I used Q Club Soda, which is one of my favorites because it is extra carbonated.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>It's a breeze to make fresh watermelon juice for this cocktail. There is so much liquid in a watermelon! This makes for a ton of fresh juice for your drinks.
                <p>Start by cutting your watermelon into chunks. You'll need about double the volume of chunks to the amount of juice you want to make, so 2 cups of chunks will make about a cup of juice once it's strained.</p>

You'll need about double the volume of chunks to the amount of juice you want to make, so 2 cups of chunks will make about a cup of juice once it's strained.Then strain the pureed watermelon through a fine mesh strainer, and store it in an airtight container like a Mason jar. You can use it right away, or it'll keep in the fridge for about 3 days.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Once you have your watermelon juice ready (instructions in the previous section, How to Make Watermelon Juice), get started making the drink by adding your fresh mint leaves to the bottom of a cocktail shaker.</li>
                <li>Then, add in the granulated sugar, and stir them together lightly with a bar spoon. The stirring action will release the natural oils in the mint without crushing it or releasing any bitterness.</li>
                <li>Add in the lime juice, and stir to start dissolving the sugar. Then, add in the watermelon juice.</li>
                <li>Add the rum to the serving glass, and then fill the glass with ice. Give it a quick stir to combine everything.</li>
                <li>Top off the drink with seltzer. Garnish the drink with a watermelon slice and a sprig of fresh mint before serving.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
