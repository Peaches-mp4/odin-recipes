    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>55 ml of watermelon juice (try to look for a ripe and in-season watermelon, since unripe melons will not have nearly as much flavor)</li>
            <li>10-12 mint leaves (fresh mint if possible)</li>
            <li>30 ml of lime juice (freshly squeezed is best)</li>
            <li>55 ml  rum</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of sugar (a traditional mojito uses cane sugar instead of simple syrup)</li>
            <li>28 ml of seltzer</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
                <li>Start by cutting your watermelon into chunks. You'll need about double the volume of chunks to the amount of juice you want to make, so 2 cups of chunks will make about a cup of juice once it's strained.</li>
                <li>Once you have your watermelon juice ready, get started making the drink by adding your fresh mint leaves to the bottom of a cocktail shaker.</li>
                <li>Then, add in the granulated sugar, and stir them together lightly with a bar spoon. The stirring action will release the natural oils in the mint without crushing it or releasing any bitterness.</li>
                <li>Add in the lime juice, and stir to start dissolving the sugar. Then, add in the watermelon juice.</li>
                <li>Add the rum to the serving glass, and then fill the glass with ice. Give it a quick stir to combine everything.</li>
                <li>Top off the drink with seltzer. Garnish the drink with a watermelon slice and a sprig of fresh mint before serving.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
