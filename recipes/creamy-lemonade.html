    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What makes creamy lemonade different from traditional lemonade? One special ingredient: sweetened condensed milk. While folks in Brazil and Vietnam have been using sweetened condensed milk in lemon and lime drinks for years, most people in the U.S. only use it for holiday pies and desserts. This may seem like a strange ingredient to add to lemonade, but trust us, you're going to love it.</p>
